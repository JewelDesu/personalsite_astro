				ABOUT ME
			</p>

			<p>
				Hi, I'm Vilius â€” a Computer Science graduate from somewhere in Europe.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I'm passionate about technology and programming, with a particular interest in servers, embedded Linux systems, and software development. <br>
				I enjoy diving into low-level systems and understanding how things work under the hood.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past, I spent time self-hosting various game servers, including Minecraft and Counter-Strike 1.6,<br> which sparked my interest in networking and server administration.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Currently dabbling in electron based application development, learning C to deepen my understanding of systems programming, and Spanish, making it my third foreign language. Always eager to explore new tech, improve my skills, and build cool stuff.
