# Enabling GSM modem with single run scripts

For those that are too busy (or too lazy) to compile it themselves because the version that comes from package managers has plugins disabled

GSM modem setup script tested on stm32mp1 board with external GSM modem module.

Needs testing on other boards/systems.





It requires 2 different scripts.
Create two bash files in directory of choice
<pre class="codecontainer"><code class="language-ini"><span class="code">root@stm32mp1:</span><span class="code">"'~#'"</span>  <span class="command">touch install.sh</span>
        <span class="code">root@stm32mp1:~#</span><span class="command"> touch install-service.sh</span></code></pre>


First open `install.sh` bash file and paste the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if running as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run as root"
  exit 1
fi

# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
#mkdir -p /etc/udev/rules.d
apt-get update & apt-get install ppp

# Copy files to their respective locations

cp connman /usr/local/bin/
cp qmi-network-raw /usr/local/bin/
cp modemstat /usr/local/bin/
cp softresetmodem.sh /usr/local/bin
cp sim.conf /etc/
cp qmi-network.conf /etc/
cp 20-modem-7xxx.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
cp 22-modem-7xxx.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

# Set correct permissions
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/connman
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/qmi-network-raw
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/modemstat
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/softresetmodem.sh
chmod 644 /etc/sim.conf
chmod 644 /etc/qmi-network.conf
chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/20-modem-7xxx.rules
chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/22-modem-7xxx.rules

# Reload udev rules
udevadm control --reload-rules

echo "Installation completed successfully."
```

Lastly the permissions need to be changed for the script file so it would be executable, run the following command to do sudo
<pre class="codecontainer"><code class="language-ini"><span class="code">root@stm32mp1:~#</span><span class="command"> chmod +x AUTO_BRIDGE.sh</span></code></pre>

Script is ready to be executed by running `./AUTO_BRIDGE.sh`
